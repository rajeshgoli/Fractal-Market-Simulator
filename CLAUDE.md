# CLAUDE.md

> **READ FIRST:** Before proceeding with any task, read `.claude/why.md` to understand why this project exists.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Market Simulator** project that implements technical analysis algorithms for detecting market structure and generating realistic OHLC price data.

**Current phase:** Ground truth annotation for swing detection validation.

For detailed architecture and current status, see `Docs/State/architect_notes.md`.

## Development Commands

### Virtual Environment
This project uses a Python virtual environment located in `venv/`. Always activate it before working:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Ground Truth Annotator
```bash
# Annotate swings on test data
python -m src.ground_truth_annotator.main --data test_data/test.csv --scale S

# Annotate with custom settings
python -m src.ground_truth_annotator.main --data es-5m.csv --resolution 5m --scale L --target-bars 300
```

### Testing
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Architecture Overview

For detailed technical architecture, see `Docs/State/architect_notes.md`.

### Source Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/swing_analysis/` | Core detection: SwingDetector, ScaleCalibrator, BarAggregator |
| `src/ground_truth_annotator/` | Web-based two-click annotation tool |
| `src/data/` | OHLC data loading and gap detection |

### Key Components

- **SwingDetector** (`swing_analysis/swing_detector.py`) - O(N log N) vectorized swing detection
- **BarAggregator** (`swing_analysis/bar_aggregator.py`) - Multi-timeframe OHLC aggregation
- **ScaleCalibrator** (`swing_analysis/scale_calibrator.py`) - Quartile-based S/M/L/XL boundaries

### Design Principles

- **Multi-scale**: Four simultaneous scales (S, M, L, XL) with independent processing
- **Fibonacci levels**: 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 1.0, 1.382, 1.5, 1.618, 2.0 ratios
- **Resolution-agnostic**: Supports 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d source data
- **Performance**: <60s for 6M bars

## Development Guidelines

### Dependencies
Core dependencies:
- **matplotlib** - Visualization and charting
- **numpy** - Numerical computations
- **pandas** - Data manipulation (legacy components)
- **pytest** - Testing framework

### Performance Targets
- **Analysis**: <60s for 6M bars (achieved)
- **Memory**: Stable usage during long sessions

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Component isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration tests**: Cross-component data flow validation  
- **Performance tests**: Latency and memory benchmarks
- **Real-world data**: Validation against historical market data

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints throughout the codebase
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Detailed docstrings with usage examples
- Configuration-driven behavior for flexibility

### Attribution
Do NOT add "Generated by Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus", or similar signatures to commits, documents, or code. This is redundant—if no human engineer is identified, Claude Code is assumed.

## Issue Resolution Workflow

When resolving GitHub issues, follow this structured process:

### 1. Investigation
- Read the issue thoroughly on GitHub (`gh issue view <number>`)
- Explore relevant code using Grep, Glob, and Read tools
- Understand the root cause before implementing

### 2. Implementation
- Make focused changes that directly address the issue
- Follow existing code patterns and style
- Add type hints and docstrings for new code

### 3. Testing
- **Write tests** for new functionality or bug fixes
- Run the test suite to verify no regressions:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
  ```
- For visualization/GUI changes, manually verify the fix works
- Ensure all relevant tests pass before proceeding

### 4. Commit and Push
- Stage only relevant files (avoid `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, etc.)
- Write descriptive commit messages:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
  Brief summary of change (fixes #<issue>)

  - Bullet point details of what changed
  - Why it was changed
  - Any notable implementation decisions
  EOF
  )"
  ```

### 5. Close Issue with Summary
- Close the issue with a detailed comment explaining the fix:
  ```bash
  gh issue close <number> --comment "Fixed in commit <hash>.

  **Summary:**
  - What was the root cause
  - What changes were made
  - How to verify the fix

  **Files changed:**
  - path/to/file.py - description of change"
  ```

### 6. Document in GitHub Issue
Add a comment to the GitHub issue with implementation notes:
- What was the root cause
- What changes were made and why
- Any gotchas or design decisions

### 7. Update User Documentation (if applicable)
If the change affects user-facing functionality:
- Update `Docs/Reference/user_guide.md`
- Add examples showing how to use new features

### 8. Update Pending Review
Update `Docs/State/pending_review.md`:
- Increment the unreviewed change count
- Add the issue number to the list

## Usage Patterns

See `Docs/Reference/user_guide.md` for detailed usage instructions.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Ground truth annotation
python -m src.ground_truth_annotator.main --data test_data/test.csv --scale S

# Run tests
source venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Development Workflows
1. **Testing changes**: Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` before commits
2. **Adding features**: Update both implementation and tests
3. **Issue workflow**: See "Issue Resolution Workflow" section below

## Current Development Phase

**Current:** Ground truth annotation tool for capturing false negatives in swing detection.

See `Docs/State/architect_notes.md` for detailed status and `Docs/State/product_direction.md` for requirements.

**Active issues:** #26 (epic), #27-#30 (implementation tasks)

## Role-Based Workflows

This project uses persona-based workflows. When asked to work as a specific role:

1. Read `.claude/personas/[role].md` first
2. Follow the workflow defined there
3. Update appropriate artifacts per handoff protocol

| Invocation | Persona | Primary Output |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| "As engineer..." | Engineer | GitHub issues + code |
| "As architect..." | Architect | `Docs/State/architect_notes.md` |
| "As product..." | Product | `Docs/State/product_direction.md` |
| "As director..." | Director | `.claude/personas/*` |

**Docs Structure:**
```
Docs/
├── State/       # Current state (single files, overwrite)
├── Comms/       # Cross-role questions
├── Reference/   # Long-lived docs (north star, user guide, interviews)
├── Working/     # Active one-off artifacts → Archive when done
├── Prompts/     # Agent prompt templates (reusable)
└── Archive/     # Historical content by topic
```

**Role Recognition:**
- Match liberally: "product manager", "PM", "product" → Product persona
- Variants like "as an architect", "from engineering perspective" → match the role keyword
- **When ambiguous, assume the role** and state it explicitly rather than proceeding without a persona
- If uncertain which role fits, ask before proceeding

See `.claude/CLAUDE_ADDENDUM.md` for full protocol.

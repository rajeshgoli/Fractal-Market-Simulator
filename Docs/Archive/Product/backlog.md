## Deferred

### MCP Server for Product Tool Access
**Added:** December 11, 2025
**Status:** Deferred
**Assessment:** `Docs/Product/Tactical/product_mcp_assessment.md`

**What:** Build an MCP server enabling Product to run the harness directly (CLI execution, screenshot capture, keyboard simulation, output parsing).

**Why deferred:**
- Single-user context with high-quality articulation
- Domain expertise required for core validation judgments
- Engineering time better spent on critical path (Event-Skip, Dynamic Aggregation)
- Current interview workflow is working

**Revisit when:**
- User articulation becomes a bottleneck
- Multiple testers are involved
- Tool enters long-term maintenance mode
- Engineering capacity exceeds critical path work

## Active Priorities

See `Docs/Product/Tactical/product_next_steps_dec11.md` for current focus:
1. Event-Skip Mode (Critical)
2. Dynamic Bar Aggregation (Critical)
3. S-Scale Swing Cap (High)
4. Stability Audit (High)

# Fractal-Market-Simulator
Fractal Market Simulator generates realistic 1-minute OHLC price data by recursively modeling market structure across timeframes. Monthly swings constrain daily, which constrain hourly, which constrain minute bars. Fibonacci-based levels, stochastic triggers, and structural rules produce self-similar price action matching real market behavior.

When playback began, \\`_append_bar()\\` tried to add bar 0 which has an earlier timestamp than bar 199 (the last bar from initialization), causing the timestamp monotonicity error.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Store \\`init_bars\\` as instance variable to track initialization boundary\n- Set playback controller''s \\`current_bar_idx\\` to \\`init_bars - 1\\` after initialization so playback continues from where initialization ended\n- Added \\`_render_initial_display()\\` method to draw OHLC bars immediately after initialization, fixing the empty panel issue\n- Fixed escaped newlines in validation CLI prompts\n\nThe visualization now shows OHLC data immediately upon session start, and playback works without timestamp errors.\")",

Time range is also shown as X-axis label.\n3. **Swing status visibility** - Status line now explicitly shows \"\"No active swings\"\" when no swings are detected at a given scale.\n\n**Still to investigate:**\n- **No visible reference swings** - This may be related to swing detection logic rather than visualization rendering. The rendering code correctly draws Fibonacci levels when swings are passed to it, so the issue may be upstream in SwingStateManager or the detection pipeline. Will investigate separately.\")",
